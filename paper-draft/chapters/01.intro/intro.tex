\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
In Astronomy, instruments with higher angular resolution allows us to measure ever smaller structures in the sky. For Radio frequencies, the angular resolution is bound to the antenna dish diameter, which puts practical and financial limitations on the highest possible angular resolution. Radio Interferometers get around this limitation by using several smaller antennas instead. Together, they act as a single large antenna with higher angular resolution at lower financial costs compared to single dish instruments.




Retrieving the observed image for Radio Interferometer becomes difficult. The Interferometer does not measure pixels of the sky. Instead, it measures an incomplete set of Fourier components. To retrieve the image, we have to solve the the Radio Interferometric Inverse Problem. We try to find the observed image, while we only know an incomplete set of Fourier Components. Due to the incomplete measurements, the inverse Problem is ill-posed, meaning we have a large number of possible images that fit the measurements. To solve this, image reconstruction algorithms try to find the most likely observed image.

Image reconstruction algorithm which tackle the ill-posed inverse problem. We have two dimensions, reconstructing an image which is as close as possible to the truly observed one, and finding an image as fast as possible. 
New Radio Interferometer produce an ever increasing number of Fourier Components. Solving the ill-posed inverse problem for newer instruments becomes more resource intensive.
Push towards distributed computing.
Only a small number of nodes, limited distribution potential.

This work does the first steps towards large-scale distribution. How can we distribute the Inverse Problem?

Look at the Inverse Problem in more detail.
Show the state-of-the-art.

%New Radio Interferometers produce an ever larger number of Fourier Components. Calculating an image in a reasonable time frame becomes an issue. Distribution Necessary. But the Radio Interferometric Inverse Problem so far has been difficult to distribute.

In this project, we handle the image reconstruction. This handles the ill-posed inverse problem.

We assume already Calibrated Visibilities. The ill-posed inverse problem is finding an image that matches the measurements. An example is shown in figure \ref{intro:inversefig}. The figure \ref{intro:inversefig:uvspace} shows the Fourier Domain of the measurements. Each dot is a measurement from a baseline.
The figure \ref{intro:inversefig:reconstruction} shows a reconstruction which fits the measurements.There are many different reconstructions that fit the measurements.

Figure \ref{intro:inversefig:uvspace} shows a the properties which make the inverse problem ill-posed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Incomplete: 
	\item Noisy: Even if we had all the information, we would have a de-noising problem.
	\item Non-Uniform sampling:
\end{enumerate}

These properties all

The reconstructed image in figure \ref{intro:inversefig:reconstruction} has generally two kinds of objects:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Point sources: Mainly stars and other far-away objects
	\item Extended emissions: blob-like shapes
\end{enumerate}


What points are sampled are defined by the Antenna layout. Sampling pattern is non-uniform in the Fourier space. Meaning we have more densely sampled areas and more sparsely sampled areas. The image \ref{intro:inversefig:uvspace} clearly shows the incompleteness of the measurements. We have "holes" in the uv-space, which is missing information.

What is an Observation. Over a time window. Create an image over several hours of measurements. This increases the number of samples that we have to deal

Noise in the Fourier Components. Amplitude and phase noise. 

Inverse Problem, We have measurements and want to find the image matching the measurements. Incomplete, there are potentially infinite number of images fitting 
the measurements. This forms an Ill-Posed inverse problem. 
Overdetermined problem, we have magnitudes more Visibilities than Pixels in the image. But noise and holes in the

Or more formally in equation \eqref{intro:inverseproblem}


\begin{equation}\label{intro:inverseproblem}
V(u, v, w) = \int\int \frac{I(x, y)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2 - y ^2}} e^{2 \pi i [ux+vy+ w(\sqrt{1 - x^2 - y ^2} - 1)]} \: dx \: dy

w-projection makes this difficult.

Difficult to calculate efficiently. $w$-term, and the non-uniform sampling pattern keeps us from using the FFT.

Representing the inverse Problem:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Interpolation Problem in the Fourier Space.
	\item Deconvolution Problem in the Image Space.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Major Cycle}

Solving the Ill-Posed inverse problem
Whole system.
From measurements to image reconstruction contains many different steps. In this project, we concern ourselves with the image reconstruction



Calibration is not directly
Bad calibration can introduce a special error in the image.

Different ways of formulating the image reconstruction problem:
Interpolating the missing Visibilities
Deconvolution (also called "Minor Cycles")
Finding an image which fits the measurements

To solve this efficiently, the question is how this can be represented in a way that we can re-use the 2d fourier transform.

\subsubsection{The Major Cycle Architecture}
State of the art architecture used for reconstructing images. It Models the problem as deconvolution, and it needs three Operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gridder
	\item FFT
	\item Deconvolution
\end{itemize}

The full algorithm is done

\subsection{Large scale Reconstruction Problem of MeerKAT}
New class of radio interferometers produce an ever increasing number of data.

Bottlenecks.
The Problem of Computation vs Quality
Image is magnitudes smaller than input data

Deconvolution with CLEAN.

Mostly Shared-Memory systems, large single machines.

GRIDDING Problem. The $w$-component of the Visibilities made this difficult. 

w-stacking, lately IDG. This has made the Gridding more efficient.

Use IDG to Distribute the Gridding.




CLEAN deconvolution still hard to parallelize.
