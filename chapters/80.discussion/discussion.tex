\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}
Approximation
And A coordinate descent algorithm that can  exploit it.

Main thing: parallel coordinate descent works.
Times comparable to standard CLEAN.
Reconstruction quality similar, or superior to serial coordinate descent
Super-resolution..
One more major cycle.
Comparable number of major cycles to CLEAN. Exact comparison is difficult

Due to our gradient approximation scheme. We exploit the fact that the $PSF$ of interferometers like MeerKAT is fairly concentrated around the center.
Exploited by the parallel coordinate descent algorithm. 
Serial coordinate descent was difficult to speedup, even with GPU and distributed reconstruction.

Easy to extend to a distributed setting, hydra.

Expect it to scale better with larger field of views. The larger the field of view, the more concentrated the $PSF$ is in relation to the whole image.
It is not clear, whether we introduce a systematic error with the approximation. We couldn't find one.

Serial coordinate descent
Similar to the standard CLEAN.
In our implementation, it did not benefit a lot from GPU acceleration. Only by a factor of 2. Unclear if this generalizes to multi-scale CLEAN.

CLEAN
CLEAN is striclty better with calibration error.
Better residuals. Compared to coordinate descent methods, it manages small iteration counts.
Our coordinate descent methods achieved super-resolution. Artificial example, but still.

Question about regularization
Used the elasticNet regularization. Cheap and easy. More sophisticated, 

Multiy frequency.






Works well for MeerKAT. Its $PSF$ is located many not work well for LOFAR.

Difficult to achieve speedup with a dense $PSF$ we approximated












\subsection{Multi frequency extension}\label{discussion:mfs}
Difficult.

Regularized inverse problem  \cite{ferrari2015multi}. Objective function 
How it works, adding a new term to the objective function

\begin{equation}\label{cd:deconv}
\underset{x}{minimize} \: \frac{1}{2} \left \| I_{dirty} - X * PSF \right \|_2^2 + \lambda ElasticNet(X) + \lambda_v \left \| DX \right \|_1
\end{equation}

Where $D$ is the Discrete cosine transform.

Does not have a proximal operator for each pixel. problem for Coordinate descent method.

Question if each iteration can be cheap.

But may be separated with respect to frequency with Lagrangian multipliers. Question if cd methods are faster.
