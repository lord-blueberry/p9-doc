\subsubsection{Major Cycle convergence}
Putting it all together

We have the Minor Cycle, which is easy to converge.

Coordinate Descent Path optimization \cite{friedman2010regularization}
Danger that CD takes too many pixel into a Major Cycle. Lower bound per iteration, PSF sidelobe
can still be too low, danger when many psf sidelobes overlap


We are in the realm of convolution. Remember that a convolution in image space is a multiplication in fourier space.
We can multiply
