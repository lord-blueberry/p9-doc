\section{Towards parallel coordinate descent}

Bells and whistles

\begin{itemize}
	\item Random
	\item Block
	\item Parallel
	\item Accelerated
\end{itemize}

PCDM algorithm, and later APPROX.

\subsection{Problems}
Problem with pure random: each update is fast, but problem with useful updates. --> we need blocks where we have a higher chance to update a pixel.

Expansion to BlockCD. Still closed form solution. But numerical problems with closed form. Solution: \cite{richtarik2014iteration}. We use the gradient step divided by the lipschitz constant.
