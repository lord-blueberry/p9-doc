\section{$PSF$ approximation for fast and distributed deconvolution} \label{gradients}
This section describes our main hypothesis of this work: Our hypothesis is that we can approximate the $PSF$ in the deconvolution problem and exploit it to speed up/distribute the deconvolution.

Our reasoning for the hypothesis comes from the Major/Minor cycle architecture. The major cycle calculates the dirty image from the visibilities. The dirty image is the product of the observed image convolved with the $PSF$ of the instrument. The deconvolution algorithm assumes the $PSF$ is constant over the image, but modern interferometers have a $w$-term, which changes the $PSF$ depending on the pixel. This is why we need the major cycle. After a number of Minor cycles (iterations of the deconvolution algorithm), we use the Major cycle to correct for the errors we introduced with the constant $PSF$. The Major cycle allows us to use an approximate $PSF$ in the deconvolution problem. We believe this can be exploited to speed up/distribute the deconvolution.

\end{figure}

A similar idea has been in use in CLEAN for decades. The Clark CLEAN algorithm \cite{clark1980efficient}. Uses only a window of the $PSF$ for the deconvolution. Figure \ref{gradients:clark} shows the full $PSF$ and the approximate $PSF$ used typically in Clark CLEAN. During deconvolution, it only uses a window around the center of the full $PSF$. Typically, the sides of the window is $\frac{1}{2}$ of the image size. By using only a $\frac{1}{2} PSF$ window around the center, a Clark CLEAN iteration is significantly faster than standard CLEAN. With $\frac{1}{2} PSF$, Clark CLEAN has to subtract only the $\frac{1}{2} PSF$ window from the residuals, which is 4 times smaller than the full $PSF$.

Using only a fraction fo the true $PSF$ speeds up the deconvolution. But it also introduces sparsity in the deconvolution problem which, to our knowledge, has not been explored for radio interferometers. The full $PSF$ shown in Figure \ref{gradients:clark} has significant values around the center, but they quickly approach zero the further away we move from the center. If we only use a window around the center $\frac{1}{2} PSF$ and set the rest to zero, we are using a sparse $PSF$. For a CLEAN algorithm, the sparse approximated $PSF$ ignores the influence of far away pixel. If we increase the approximation, the deconvolution problem becomes increasingly separable into image facets. With a $\frac{1}{8} PSF$, we can split the image into 16 facets, 4 of which are independent from each other. This problem can be easily distributed onto 4 nodes, each deconvolving an independent facet in parallel.

The important question is, how small can the center window be? Can we guarantee that the algorithm converges to the same solution, even with an approximated $PSF$? We will test the effect of an approximate $PSF$ with our serial coordinate descent algorithm  on a real-world observation in Section \ref{results:gradients}. In this section, we show how we can incorporate an approximate $PSF$ into our serial coordinate descent algorithm.


\subsection{$PSF$ approximation for the serial coordinate descent algorithm}
The serial coordinate descent algorithm keeps the gradient map, the product $PSF \star PSF$ and the current reconstruction in memory. In each iteration, the algorithm first finds the pixel, which has the maximum possible difference in this iteration. In the second step, it subtracts the product $PSF \star PSF$ at the correct location of the gradient map. The gradient map is now updated for the next iteration of the serial coordinate descent algorithm. 

We approximate the $PSF$ by only using a window around the center. Each side is only a fraction of the full $PSF$ size. From now on, we use the method $Cut()$, which cuts out the center window of the $PSF$. If we use a cut fraction of $\frac{1}{4}$, we cut out a window of the $PSF$, each side being  $\frac{1}{4}$ the length of the full $PSF$.

Using an approximate $PSF$ influences three parts of the algorithm: The gradient map, the Lipschitz map and the product $PSF \star PSF$. At the beginning of the algorithm, we calculate the gradient map by correlating the dirty image with the $PSF$ ($I_{dirty} \star PSF$) We also calculate the Lipschitz constants for each pixel. The product $PSF \star PSF$ is used to update the gradient map in each iteration. We developed two approximation methods for the serial coordinate descent algorithm. Method 1 is called 'approximate update', and method 2 is called 'approximate deconvolution'. 

\subsubsection{Method 1: Approximate update}
The approximate update method only uses the approximate $PSF$ for updating the gradient map. Instead of using the product $PSF \star PSF$, this method uses the product $Cut(PSF) \star Cut(PSF)$ to update the gradient map in each iteration. Figure \ref{gradients:update:figure} shows the effect of the approximation.

	\end{subfigure}
	
	\caption{Approximation of gradient update.}
	\label{gradients:update:figure}
\end{figure} 

This method uses the full $PSF$ to initialize the gradient and the Lipschitz map. But it only uses an approximation for the update in each iteration of serial coordinate descent. The error we introduce with the approximation gets more severe with more iterations of serial coordinate descent. But the upside is the first iteration in every Major cycle is always identical to the serial coordinate descent algorithm without approximation. This means with enough major cycles, we are guaranteed to converge to the same result.


\subsubsection{Method 2: Approximate deconvolution}
This method also uses the approximate gradient update. But instead of initializing the gradient map with the full $PSF$, it also uses the approximate $PSF$ for initializing the gradient and the Lipschitz map. In essence, this method solves an approximate deconvolution problem:

\begin{equation}\label{gradients:method2:objective}
\underset{x}{minimize} \: \frac{1}{2} \left \| I_{dirty} - x * Cut(PSF) \right \|_2^2 + \lambda ElasticNet(x)
\end{equation}

This method does not introduce an error in every serial coordinate descent iteration. But it comes with the downside: It is not guaranteed to converge to the same result as the serial coordinate descent without approximation. It systematically under-estimates the pixel values in the reconstructed image.

To combat the under-estimation of pixel values, we reduce the regularization parameter $\lambda$ for the approximate deconvolution problem. Since we cut off parts of the $PSF$, we also reduce the Lipschitz constant (sum of the squared $PSF$ values) used in the approximate deconvolution. We reduce the $\lambda$ parameter by the same factor that the Lipschitz constant gets reduced. This ensures that the approximate deconvolution and the original deconvolution arrive at the same pixel value for a point source in theory. But it does not completely remove the issue for extended emissions.


\subsubsection{Combining the two approximation methods}
The two approximation methods developed here have opposing downsides: Method 1 is guaranteed to converge to the same result, given enough major cycles, but becomes increasingly inaccurate with more serial coordinate descent iterations. Method 2 does not become increasingly inaccurate, but is not guaranteed to converge to the same result, even with an infinite number of Major cycles.

The obvious question is, what happens when we combine the two approximation method. Indeed, this is our final solution in this project. We start out with method 2, the approximate deconvolution for a few Major cycles, and then switch to method 1, approximate update. When combining both methods, we decided to switch from method 2 to method 1 when the serial coordinate descent has converged.


\subsection{Major Cycle convergence and implicit path regularization}\label{gradients:pathreg}
There is one problem with the approximate $PSF$ which is left to solve: When does the serial coordinate descent algorithm decide to use a Major cycle. Or when we combine the $PSF$ approximation methods, how many Major cycles do we use for each method?

When we use an approximate $PSF$, the deconvolution algorithm will at a certain iteration start to include 'side lobes' of the $PSF$. The Figure \ref{gradient:convergence:sidelobe} shows an example of the side lobes we introduce by approximating the $PSF$ with $\frac{1}{2}$ of the center window. At a certain point, the deconvolution with an approximate $PSF$ has to decide whether the emission is real, or whether it is an artifact from the $PSF$ approximation, and will be removed with the next major cycle.

\end{figure}

For example: if we have an observation with a single point source in the center, the first iteration of Clark CLEAN will subtract the approximate $PSF$ from the residuals. But the residual image is left with the $PSF$ side lobes shown in Figure \ref{gradient:convergence:reverseCut}. The next iteration may detect 'fake' point sources at the significant side lobes of the $PSF$. Our serial coordinate descent algorithm does not explicitly use the residual image, but has a similar problem. The information of the residual image is implicitly contained in the gradient map. Our serial coordinate descent algorithm with an approximate $PSF$ leaves significant gradients in the map.

This is a problem for deconvolving an image with the Major cycle. If we let our serial coordinate descent algorithm converge to a result in each Major cycle, it will include emission from the $PSF$ side lobes. In the next Major cycle, the serial coordinate descent algorithm has to remove the side lobes from the reconstruction, but this again leaves significant side lobes in the gradient map. This can lead to an oscillation of the algorithm, where it adds and removes the same side lobes several times over different Major cycles. In extreme cases (for example when we use an aggressive approximation of the $PSF$), this may even lead to a diverging behavior. But even if the deconvolution algorithm converges over several Major cycles, if the algorithm spends too much time on $PSF$ side lobes, it may become significantly slower.

To solve this problem, we use the following strategy for our serial coordinate descent algorithm: We estimate the $PSF$ side lobes introduced by the approximation. We increase the regularization parameter $\lambda$, until the elastic net regularization excludes all side lobes from the reconstruction. Note that real emission may also be regularized away in the current Major cycle iteration. The serial coordinate descent algorithm reconstructs the image with the current $\lambda$, and lets the Major cycle remove the side lobes. It then estimates the current $PSF$ side lobes for this Major cycle, sets a lower regularization parameter $\lambda$ and again deconvolves the image.

This is known as a path regularization in optimization. We let our optimization algorithm converge on intermediate solution, decrease the $\lambda$ parameter and use the intermediate solution as a 'warm start'. Coordinate descent methods may benefit from path regularization\cite{friedman2010regularization}. Converging on all intermediate solutions may result in a lower wall-clock time than converging directly on the final solution.

We use the path regularization to stop the algorithm from wasting computing resources on side lobes. There may be different strategies that result in an overall lower wall-clock time for the serial coordinate descent algorithm, but they were not explored in this project. We set the regularization parameter $\lambda$ for each Major cycle according to the following estimate:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
maxSidelobe &= Max(PSF - Cut(PSF)) \\
gradients &= residuals \star PSF \\
maxLobeGradient &= Max(gradients) * maxSidelobe \\
\lambda_{cycle} &= \frac{maxLobeGradient}{\alpha}\\
\lambda_{cycle} &= Max(\lambda, \lambda_{cycle})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

We calculate the maximum side lobe of the $PSF$ approximation. We then multiply the maximum side lobe with the maximum gradient. This is an estimate of the largest gradient value, which gets left in the gradient map by the $PSF$ approximation. We then set the $\lambda_{cycle}$ parameter to exclude all gradients equal or smaller that gradient magnitude. The maximum of the gradient map decreases over every Major cycle, which leads to a decreasing $\lambda_{cycle}$ until we reached the target value $\lambda$.

This estimate works, but it has one problem for radio interferometric imaging: It does not account for extended emissions. Since they have non-zero pixel values close to each other, their $PSF$ side lobes also overlap. Meaning the $PSF$ side lobes of extended emissions are higher than we estimated. This is why we added a correction factor which estimates how much the maximum in the gradient map is point-source-like:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
maxSidelobe &= Max(PSF - cut(PSF)) \\
gradients &= residuals \star PSF \\
\textbf{correction} &= Max(1, \frac{Max(gradients)}{Max(residuals) * Lipschitz}) \\
maxLobeGradient &= Max(gradients) * maxSidelobe * correction \\
\lambda_{cycle} &= \frac{maxLobeGradient}{\alpha}\\
\lambda_{cycle} &= Max(\lambda, \lambda_{cycle})
\end{split}
\end{equation}

It the same estimate as before, except for the correction factor. The correction factor is 1 if the maximum in the gradient map is a point source, and $1 <$ if the maximum in the gradient map is more like an extended emission. The correction factor is based on the following observation: If the image only contains point sources, then the maximum of the gradient map should be equal the maximum of the residuals times the Lipschitz constant. But if it is an extended emission, the maximum of the gradient map will be significantly larger.

This is the estimate we use for the regularization parameter $\lambda_{cycle}$ for each Major cycle. The parameter $\lambda_{cycle}$ decreases over each Major cycle, resulting in an implicit path regularization for our serial coordinate descent method.
