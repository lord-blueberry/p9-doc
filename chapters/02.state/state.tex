\section{State of the Art image reconstruction}\label{state}

Image reconstruction pipelines are split in two taks. Gridding and deconvolution. We introduce here the two latest gridding algorithms, $w$-stacking in \ref{state:wstack} and Image Domain Gridder \ref{state:idg}.

Deconvolution we discuss CLEAN and MORESANE.

Not all algorithms are here from

\subsection{Multi-scale CLEAN}

Multi scale, multi-frequency extension of the standard CLEAN algorithm.

Multi-frequency is for wide-band imaging, which is out of scope. We limit ourselves to the multi-scale variant.

Cleans different resolutions.

First chooses a resolution
Performs a number of standard CLEAN on the selected resolution.

Various Improvements and speedups\cite{clark1980efficient, schwab1984relaxing, rau2011multi, offringa2017optimized}, but the core algorithm is still this.

\subsection{MORESANE}

Uses the starlet wavelet

Generally produces better results than multi-scale CLEAN, but is less robust versus calibration errors.

The basic algorithm is??
