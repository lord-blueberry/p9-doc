\section{State of the Art image reconstruction}\label{state}

Image reconstruction pipelines are split in two taks. Gridding and deconvolution. We introduce here the two latest gridding algorithms, $w$-stacking in \ref{state:wstack} and Image Domain Gridder \ref{state:idg}.

Deconvolution we discuss CLEAN and MORESANE.

Not all algorithms are here from

\subsubsection{CLEAN}

Various Improvements and speedups\cite{clark1980efficient, schwab1984relaxing, rau2011multi, offringa2017optimized}, but the core algorithm is still this.
